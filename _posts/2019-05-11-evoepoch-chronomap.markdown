[VIEW EVO EPOCH CHRONO MAP](https://mxnkpl.com/chronomap.html)
## Evo Epoch Chrono Map:
The Evolutionary Epochs Chrono Map is a detailed map type cheatsheet that spreads out some points in time that tries to put in to account how revolutionary an invention is based on other variables around it.

The idea is to try provide the research links attached to each object, and keep inspiration running free.

Adobe Illustrator File is still under WIP. (Currently at the Atomic Era) - Significant congestion of innovation during this time so I will need to revisit the spread out scale.

To follow will be a spreadsheet with all the pertinent events and dates to share, as well as the links to the research. Each time I circle back to the point in history, with a different perspective I come up with another layer of events.

My cheatsheet was created as a quick mock up or prototype of explaining specific points in time in why things are all connected.

## Studying Tooling as Tools for Tools
As I've learned with my UI/UX bias snafu - its important for me to document or at least understand where the disconnect was and plot it out to gain knowledge, alot of patterns repeat itself so for sure this will come in handy.

When I read about bootstrapping being an actual 'thing',
I was both excited and humbled by how profound and all encompassing it actually is. Almost all sciences have evolved through this need, Histiology the study or studies, etc.

How are these terms so philosophical and intuitive? I have a presumption that it is because computer sciences is the amalgamation of logic, philosophy, biology, evolution, humanities and psychology with LEAN UX methodologies, then neuroscience with AI or machine learning.

The biggest learning expereince is to think exponentially. Looking for the tiny fragments that built time then viewing it as a whole picuture gives a dizzying effect.

Interestingly this must have what discovery felt like during the beginnning of time since each incremental change in knowledge (or the very first one) has nothing to compare it to.

There is also the proof that all the revolutions are ignited by peoples abilities to start sharing knowledge. "Guttenberg democratized revolution" to evolution is like the first microprocessor to computers...
[Guttenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratization_of_knowledge)

The expanding universe can explain a lot of the behavior, but I'm not quite sure how, It follows the same accordion pattern and on a macro level biology mirrors self-singularity.
(I want to write more about my Alan Turing Research he deserves all the acknoledgement, for now here's how he predicted A.I.)   [AlanTuring](https://singularityhub.com/2019/03/26/what-would-it-mean-for-ai-to-become-conscious/)

Blind cartography during the dark ages, scientific maps, tuftean design, to reaching for the stars to map out a cosmological universe that brings us back to the beginning of time. Humanity has evolved through exploring the immeasurable unknown. If today would be the product design [renaissance][8]
it would be good to look at the change of romanticism towards new ideas through out time. Space and time factors indicate for a technical project to research alone (with supervised set rules) would not be pragmatic but thats when information architecture plays a key role in human form...
Storing, Retrieving, Sorting are complex algorithms that should be revered as poetry and I didn't understand until I looked up what was around them.


## About
What really kept me going is imagining a world where people would enjoy and share
 this interactive pdf, use the links as guides to let your imagination run as
 accurately wild as the internet allows me to.


## Big Bang Connection
The big bang theory theme song may have influenced me, to a certain extent, in film class
adding continuity is taught early on so that one could incorporate a continuation early on and it was my favorite design aspect of making films. For example, how young sheldon ties in the whole series by going back to how Sheldon became Sheldon. Whenever things are tied in together I am fully amused. Furthermore if it is almost seemless.

Succinctly enough when I got the start of the internet era,(in the chronomap) I came across the Tim Berner's Lee talk
[Tim Berner's Lee](https://youtu.be/OM6XIICm_qo)
about sharing links and data. There is a layer of security and stability to worry about though if the entire
program is based on links that keep changing.

## Collective Intelligence connection
I throughly resonate with the aspects that relate to Collective Intelligence that Englebart spoke of. I researched a little abit about him to try to imagine what was available to him when he envisioned the mother of all demos.
albeit alittle presumptious: 1.) He married an occupational therapist just a few years before he creates the mouse.
2.) He is challenged by the limitations in communicating ideas in his work place, envisioned an all in one unit, more then the mouse was the screen and a separate keyboard system that was hard for him to explain and still hard to describe now.
[Douglas Englebart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart)

Thinking about how profound our thoughts have evolved overtime, holds the logic that my human side needs to avoid
imagination burnout. The roadmap points out the intersections where change broke through.

p.s. (Its important to note that the information I have gathered is different in other parts of the hemisphere, we have not come that far from the euro-centric mis-scaled maps during the age of discovery. Also most inventions come from a collective understanding of new sciences or adapting to a new paradigm shift. To put in perspective these end points might just be the tips of the icebergs.)
