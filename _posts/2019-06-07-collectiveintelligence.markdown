## Why


---
Evolutionarily speaking, I think humanities is the foundation of Computer Science and Information technology.

To plot out maps to navigate an unknown world.  
[Douglass Englebart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart)
 talks about Collective Intelligence, (the creator of the mouse) quit a steady job to make the world a better place - then
 created "The mother of all demos" (in San Francisco) [Mother of all Demos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos).
 He first coined it "X-Y position indicator for a display system" and included and


Ted Nelson who developed [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) the first hypertext project, a digital repository scheme for world-wide electronic publishing.. (Also was critizied for being "Vaporwave" - which has been a big debate between developers and public demand - was called a "scarlett letter" for developers and an overused and abused word like a noose around their neck.)
In this ["The curse of Xanadu"](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/) article he is quoted :
 "Attention Deficit Disorder was coined by regularity chauvinists," he remarked. "Regularity chauvinists are people who insist that you have got to do the same thing every time, every day, which drives some of us nuts. Attention Deficit Disorder - we need a more positive term for that. Hummingbird mind, I should think."

He also called the term [Intertwingularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity).
 "Hierarchical and sequential structures, especially popular since Gutenberg, are usually forced and artificial. Intertwingularity is not generally acknowledged."
