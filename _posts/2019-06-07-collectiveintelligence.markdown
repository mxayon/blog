## Douglass Englebart

[Douglass Englebart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart)
 talks about Collective Intelligence, (the creator of the mouse) quit a steady job to make the world a better place - then
 created ["The Mother of all Demos"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos)for a conference in San Francisco.
 He first coined it "X-Y position indicator for a display system" and included and one of the first graphical user interface to work with it.
He wanted to extend the way humans interacted with computers, and knew this was important to how we could utilize machines for empowering human creativity and connection.

## Ted Nelson and the Hummingbird mind
![Ted Interwingular](http://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Spring14/161/projects/noopur/4-structure/html/deep.png)
In my research, I found another fascinating mind and role model to look up to..
<br>
Ted Nelson who developed [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) the first hypertext project, a digital repository scheme for world-wide electronic publishing..

(Xanadu was also critized for being "Vaporwave" - which has been a big debate between developers and public demand - was called a "scarlet letter" for developers and an overused and abused word like a noose around their neck.)
In this ["The curse of Xanadu"](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/) article he is quoted :
 "Attention Deficit Disorder was coined by regularity chauvinists," he remarked. "Regularity chauvinists are people who insist that you have got to do the same thing every time, every day, which drives some of us nuts. Attention Deficit Disorder - we need a more positive term for that. Hummingbird mind, I should think."

He also called the term [Intertwingularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity).
 "Hierarchical and sequential structures, especially popular since Gutenberg, are usually forced and artificial. Inter-wingularity is not generally acknowledged."

These intentional inventors, gave respect to the inter-dimensionality of observable patterns. And believed in a greater 'Collective Intelligence' that self-singularly evolves with an environment that allows the connections to be made.
