## Mind sized bites

---

Information overload can deter receptivity. A good film - using all the design elements within the films resources -
doesn't need to test the boundaries of pleasing the audience - can thoroughly shock or pack a punch if you will, with
the motion forcing you to think of how to keep things suggestive and fluid.

There is some wizardry to how knowledge is transferred at the right cadence how film uses all the elements in its power,
color, timing, framing, story build up, to open up receptors to full engagement before "dropping the mic".

First successful "Repurposed" shot from unusable archived data.


## Storyline Framework

Each project has objectives: a Introduction, a concept to establish / Build up,
Solve problem - make connections - pivotal peak, Conclusion / aftercare. The project goal segments
complete the storyline - the projects main framework. Template need based projects are usually based on the
viewer / communicator's intentions. Event based templates, Subject based templates, Archive based are the main
communication storylines for templating. Free-form serves as a more compounded approach to the assembly of the story line.

Sticking to one pivotal peak per project, keeps each project well packaged for distribution. The same as staging incremental
changes in development. The draft stage would be the beta stage where project file will go through all necessary feedback
loop layers to meet the standard. Sound quality, Color quality and over all Timing are the most important factors for the
initial feedback loop layer, conducted by designer / producer. Sent off to 2nd draft phase, immediate feedback loop,
external feedback loop, real-time feedback loop under discretion of designer and content.

The data labeled from unsupervised footage should be grouped into a date-event description folder, for example,
saved items consists of the footage that have at least 6 seconds of ["usable"][1] clip time, label implies if there are more.
More keywords in a label, more content to scale. Date, Subject Name and Subject Action helps arrange the order it will be stored.

## Product Packaging

Knowing when to "own the moment" refines with time.
Heuristic learning for creating better composition, purposeful design choices on a timeline can be either dragged
or pedestaled, still frame version is the concept not in practice. Repurposing a clip can achieve this effect through
dimension or effects.

Depending on the need, the objectives of the storyline or branch fragments are divided into User-centric based repositories:
#### Template
* supervised vs unsupervised footage

#### Free-Line
* supervised vs unsupervised footage
Free-Line is where the knowledge of what to do with the footage comes into play, its best to plot out a plan first to avoid unnecessary crashes.
A well discussed wire-frame, story-board or story plot maybe sufficient intra-framework if trust is encapsulated in a fortified incremental feedback cycle.
The opportunity to evolve from "real-time" constructive criticism will propel
3 factors:
1) Unlike the Free-Line that may or may not adapt the template convention, template format is used for crafting with specific objectives that are optimized to convey broken down concepts
with unsupervised footage. Free line can use or reject these rules to sculpture the experience.
2) Footage improvements - specifically if 2-3 more feedback cycles are implemented during footage capture phase to improve purposeful decision making on a macro still frame scale.
3) Template has it's own dynamically evolving relationships when Template-timing is considered. As you can see the divisions / time cuts as the footage capture phase happens fast in real time. I learned how to get a better sense of how to stretch things with the angle to suggest a continuation of a concept or feeling (or object).

> Edward Tufte talks about how PowerPoint was used by NASA engineers in the events leading to the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. The software style is designed to persuade rather than to inform people of technical details. Tufte's analysis of a NASA PowerPoint slide is included in the Columbia Accident Investigation Board’s report—including an engineering detail buried in small type on a crowded slide with six bullet points, that if presented in a regular engineering white paper, might have been noticed and the disaster prevented.
[Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte)

- I think the missing factor to persuasion is repetition. Continuity as an extension of a 2- dimensional design objective, if only the one "object" of mis-persuaded could have been stretched on either screen time depth or repetition and variation.


The key to working with unsupervised data is to analyze it first, take note of ["usuable"][1] segments.

## Project Objectives
Free-Line is independent to content archive.
Dependent on a story board to create new footage,
typical ideation stage needs its own feedback stage.
Each footage capture goes through its incremental approach
of sanity checks and experimentation to improve on each fragment of the story line.
I think of it as the TDD, to creating the final product.
Each clip is processed before storage phase.

Template format is mostly dependent on your storage. Additional data is gathered to support objectives.
Typically, Event, Subject or Archive based projects are requests from viewer or message conveyer where it is
imperative (and Agile-like) to be flexible to the viewers needs from the beginning. To save time on changes,
this part is particularly more important for the template format since the template interweaves a strict 6 second
prime focus shot to 2 second transition rule. Rat focus can be implemented to loosely move the 6 second rule depend
cadence of the audio. The wireframe for project concept should have project objectives established,
with audio (or description to set tone) for introduction, concept, peak and resolution.

## Incubator : Audio peak meters

Audio decision should take as much research as needed as it sets entire theme. Key frames on the storyline mark
the points for each story phase. This sets the environment for the ideation phase. Have resources knolled out, imagine multiple outcomes
of each choice, have a sense of what the desired outcome is first before offering multiple ideas. Each offer weighed out deliberately to reduce
risk of creative burnout, in terms of seeing if juxtaposition of audio and video work. Often times the song you imagine you want to work with
is a song that would make it harder for the pieces to connect.

(Most music videos follow the storyboard supervised footage format, most templated formats follow an unsupervised but strict, cookie cutter format. What has worked best, keeping myself - possessed into hours of scrutiny- and my viewers engaged was an audio centered template. A really fancy way to say "fan video or cover video". I prefer to think of it as my heliocentric model of the editingverse.)

## Transitions and Repurposing
Interestingly enough, if the transition or footage cut (if you'd like a sharp effect)
is set on the down beat, it creates a seamless effect. Manually storing and labelling
data gives you the advantage of predicting which clips to prioritize or repurpose. Sometimes there is a subset of unusable clips
that could be repurposed to assist the theme. The result of repurposed clips are usually polarized, usually a decision
between sacrificing quality over production time & space complexities and rendering downtime.

Repurposing the footage via dimensions or effects, can be used to build the intro and resolution.
Repurposing runs up a lot of rendering time, compression errors are usually the biggest reason of system crashes and unsaved work.
Repurposed files with 2/ more layers with effects can put a heavy load on the render engine.
Repurposing effects shifts color, mood and theme, and can be used as effective story telling tool but a de-facto attachment to
effects is hard to cure like a moth to a flame..
Repurposing with dimension can have parallel running stories making more connections. There's length of clip in seconds, there's a grid dimension
on the 2d plane, the 3rd dimension or layer is the depth in layers (or the layer cake).
Timing multiple effects on each layer of the layer cake can open up "the sweet spot" to invoke a change in story, theme, mood, to ingrate seamlessly to next frame - depending on how compatible the change is to the transitional effect given by the fade - in fade out movement.

Repurposed files that work can be a good resource in any other related projects. When labelling repurposed effect, what to prioritize in the label convention will help the archival process in the future.


## Content / Data:
These are the video clips stored in a hard drive or video bank.
Supervised
    These are typically drawn out with a story board. Arranging elements like color sound
    recording style are strategically devised to tell the story.
    Infographics, Tutorials or Documentary type packages and storyline is built mostly out of gathered data.
    Supervised gathered data should be well organized and documented, although likely hood of reusing the exact same element is
    less than other video bank files.

Unsupervised
  The "live" stuff.

  Data gathering or the cinematography is best if it can be previewed (either during or after shooting) but best
  filtered before storage. This saves time in the video review/ label portion. A first hand perspective in the filming
  the shots reduces review time significantly. As well as setting up an automatic feedback process to instantiate data
  gathering cycle.

[1][Usuable]: Here are some simple rules to follow for knowing usuable data. (video footage)
      a. Exposure - daytime shooting offers great light for subject but video is over exposed if background is
      washed out. Constantly recalibrating angles affects the color and quality of the shot. Experimentation
      in similar settings is necessary during capturing unsupervised data. Knowing what to take from the experiment
      as well only got better after finding the right question to research. Knowing photography, in order to know when to
      adapt its rules to your moment, on a macro scale. (I practiced in a moving car when I first started.)
        * I noticed that owning a video or product from ideation to creation helps retain a sense of objectivity between
        the work and art compromise regardless of task.
      b. Subjects - should be prioritized by project objectives.
      Its good to have sets of single subject footage labeled for accessible order. The order of supervised data
      labelling depends on subject - communication goal order. If clip has less than 3 visible subjects, it's best to
      label all. Usually more than 6 is a good rule of thumb for compiling subjects to a label, unless you want to use a cryptic
      abreviation for subjects depending on what you want to keep track of.
    Compound Subjects are more likely reusable in multiple projects,
      establishing your rules for your data organization is an important foot hold.

### Subject Naming Guide
- Single Subj. label: Noun, Object. Footage is typically human focused. ** Mostly pancake lenses with small aperture
         are best for high resolution portrait type solos.
- Important to factor technological design decision of camera lens, type, angle, motion and lighting.
      * any results to experiments or change in lens, type, angle, motion or lighting can hold key elements to to improve the
        data gathering cycle.
- Compound Subj. label - It's best to set rules early on.
            a. Identify subjects with in footage for use or archive. Describe subjects from usable
            portions of the clip.
            b. Key words and organization makes sure observation does not get lost in abyss. If a really well composed artistic
            shot I could use of a perfectly exposed popular location for example is labeled incorrectly during another project,
            the results will not be the same.

## Full Circle Resolution

Establish connection, remember that the average attention span is short, try to review objectively by temporarily removing ownership
of story objectives to understand what has been played on screen, specially when attempting to repurpose a shot, even if desired result is
achieved a juxtaposition without purpose damages the integrity.

Following these standards improve my craftsmanship each time.
