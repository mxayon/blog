## Mind sized bites

---

Information overload can deter receptivity. A good film - using all the design elements within the films resources -
doesn't need to test the boundaries of pleasing the audience - can thoroughly shock or pack a punch if you will, with
the motion forcing you to think of how to keep things suggestive and fluid.

There is some wizardry to how knowledge is transferred at the right cadence how film uses all the elements in its power,
color, timing, framing, story build up, to open up receptors to full engagement before "dropping the mic".

## Storyline Framework

Each project has objectives: a Introduction, a concept to establish / Build up,
Solve problem - make connections - pivotal peak, Conclusion / aftercare. The project goal segments
complete the storyline - the projects main framework. Template need based projects are usually based on the
viewer / communicator's intentions. Event based templates, Subject based templates, Archive based templates are the main
communication storylines for templating. Free-form serves as a more compounded approach to the assembly of the story line.

Sticking to one pivotal peak per project, keeps each project well packaged for distribution. The same as staging incremental
changes in development. The draft stage would be the beta stage where project file will go through all necessary feedback
loop layers to meet the standard. Sound quality, Color quality and over all Timing are the most important factors for the
initial feedback loop layer, conducted by designer / producer. Sent off to 2nd draft phase, immediate feedback loop,
external feedback loop, real-time feedback loop under discretion of designer and content.

The data labeled from unsupervised footage should be grouped into a date-event description folder, for example,
saved items consists of the footage that have at least 6 seconds of "[usable][1]" clip time, label implies if there are more.
More keywords in a label, more content to scale. Date, Subject Name and Subject Action helps arrange the order it will be stored.



.. (Ask me for more!) ..


## Content / Data:
These are the video clips stored in a hard drive or video bank.
Supervised
    These are typically drawn out with a story board. Arranging elements like color sound
    recording style are strategically devised to tell the story.
    Infographics, Tutorials or Documentary type packages and storyline is built mostly out of gathered data.
    Supervised gathered data should be well organized and documented, although likely hood of reusing the exact same element is
    less than other video bank files.

Unsupervised
  The "live" stuff.

  Data gathering or the cinematography is best if it can be previewed (either during or after shooting) but best
  filtered before storage. This saves time in the video review/ label portion. A first hand perspective in the filming
  the shots reduces review time significantly. As well as setting up an automatic feedback process to instantiate data
  gathering cycle.
***
[1][Usuable]: Here are some simple rules to follow for knowing usuable data. (video footage)
      a. Exposure - daytime shooting offers great light for subject but video is over exposed if background is
      washed out. Constantly recalibrating angles affects the color and quality of the shot. Experimentation
      in similar settings is necessary during capturing unsupervised data. Knowing what to take from the experiment
      as well only got better after finding the right question to research. Knowing photography, in order to know when to
      adapt its rules to your moment, on a macro scale. (I practiced in a moving car when I first started.)
        * I noticed that owning a video or product from ideation to creation helps retain a sense of objectivity between
        the work and art compromise regardless of task.
      b. Subjects - should be prioritized by project objectives.
      Its good to have sets of single subject footage labeled for accessible order. The order of supervised data
      labelling depends on subject - communication goal order. If clip has less than 3 visible subjects, it's best to
      label all. Usually more than 6 is a good rule of thumb for compiling subjects to a label, unless you want to use a cryptic
      abreviation for subjects depending on what you want to keep track of.
    Compound Subjects are more likely reusable in multiple projects,
      establishing your rules for your data organization is an important foot hold.

### Subject Naming Guide
- Single Subj. label: Noun, Object. Footage is typically human focused. ** Mostly pancake lenses with small aperture
         are best for high resolution portrait type solos.
- Important to factor technological design decision of camera lens, type, angle, motion and lighting.
      * any results to experiments or change in lens, type, angle, motion or lighting can hold key elements to to improve the
        data gathering cycle.
- Compound Subj. label - It's best to set rules early on.
            a. Identify subjects with in footage for use or archive. Describe subjects from usable
            portions of the clip.
            b. Key words and organization makes sure observation does not get lost in abyss. If a really well composed artistic
            shot I could use of a perfectly exposed popular location for example is labeled incorrectly during another project,
            the results will not be the same.

## Full Circle Resolution

Establish connection, remember that the avereage attention span is short, try to review objectively by temporarily removing ownership
of story objectives to understand what has been played on screen, specially when attempting to repurpose a shot, even if desired result is
achieved a juxtaposition without purpose damages the integrity.

Following these standards improve my craftsmanship each time.
