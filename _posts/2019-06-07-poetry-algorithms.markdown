## Why

We are evolving and must think the same as the end receiver of the communication channel, the influx of data accelerating increases the consumption rate we're used to..

Cogito Ergo Sum, the self realizing logic that instantiates an object to existence in the same form
poetry sets a feeling moving.

von Neumann - who created game theory -  [Zero-sum Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) during the cold war and came up with a system of "Mutually Assured Destruction" - which was the start of the internet today.

[von Neumann-book](https://books.google.com/books?id=2-PeDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=self+actualization+von+neumann&source=bl&ots=0yT0NkPSTl&sig=ACfU3U1MPr7F7pvcjtnBs9gP98Wayb0i3Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj8ycjS6uDiAhUBHDQIHUnyB5o4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=self%20actualization%20von%20neumann&f=false) Conway's "Game of Life" and Stephen Wolfram knows that interactive algorithms are more important than the underlying mathemathical equations.  The spatial and temporal interaction among entities is key to understanding their complexity.

The Turing degree (named after Alan Turing) or degree of un-solvability of a set of natural numbers measures the level of algorithmic un-solvability of the set..
[Turing Degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_degree) evolved into the turing test.

His version of self-singularity develops in a constructivism sense.

Constructivism
Default Operations
* Survivability - motion and event, spontaneous alternation, and principle of least effort. (crisis mode)
* Creative Operations - cognitive functions, tool making, figurative thinking, primitive learning and creativity.
* Social Behaviors - foraging, navigation, facial recognition, privacy, stealth & autonomy.
* Self-Awareness - self-recognition for self or non-self identification, self-replication, sensuality and euphoria.
*divisions are not absolute*



Constructivism covers the philosophical dimension in Self-Singular systems by asking how human intelligence has evolved over time. The pinnacle moments are when the new paved ways sync up to new things.

[Constructivism is explained...](https://www.learning-theories.com/constructivism.html#concepts)
>Constructivism as a paradigm or worldview posits that learning is an active, constructive process. The learner is an information constructor. People actively construct or create their own subjective representations of objective reality. New information is linked to to prior knowledge, thus mental representations are subjective.

>Knowledge is constructed based on personal experiences and hypotheses of the environment. Learners continuously test these hypotheses through social negotiation. Each person has a different interpretation and construction of knowledge process. The learner is not a blank slate (tabula rasa) but brings past experiences and cultural factors to a situation

Piaget's Theory of Intellectual Growth evolved into to Vygotsky's addition of a ZDP and his understanding of the socio-historical psychology of learning put Constructivism in motion.

[Historical and Contemporary Significance of Vygotsky's Sociohistorical Psychology](http://www.sonic.net/~cr2/sociohis.htm)
>Whereas most other psychologists postulate intra-organismic determinants of psychological phenomena (such as physiological mechanisms or free will) or some interaction between intra-organismic and social factors, Vygotsky regarded human psychology as entirely social.

>An adult's essence is found in the essence of the environmental conditions.
                                              -Vygotsky and Luria, 1930/1993


Today, Constructivism is a new wave of evolutionary learning brought by computers and 2d / 3d digestion.
[Constructivism and Technology](http://www.teach-nology.com/currenttrends/constructivism/and_technology/)

> Constructivism and technology are working hand-in-hand in the present day. With regards to geometry, constructivism and technology work together to produce a better understanding of the middle school curriculum. Students should be able to identify direction, orientation, have a clear perception of object relation. Making logical deductions from the geometric shapes and patterns is the next step in this learning process. Constructivism and technology allow for computers to generate both two-dimensional objects and three-dimensional objects on the screen. This enables students to view the screen and move the shapes either to another side, turned around completed, or stretched, turned, or flipped. This gives the students a better perspective of the item which they cannot hold in their hand. They can then develop better understanding of spatial sense.

Constructivism broke free from instructionalism when theorists started asking these 3 main questions...

* What does it mean to know something?
* How do we come to know it?
* How does this knowledge influence our thinking processes?


The first dimension defines the constructivist position along a continuum between an understanding of reality as being objective at one end, and a view that reality is defined subjectively at the other end.

The second dimension defines each position on a continuum where knowledge is either socially constructed at the one end, or individually constructed at the other end. This dimension examines the degree to which social, contextual, and cultural factors determine our constructed knowledge.

Despite the differences of each position along these two dimensions, each constructivist position has underlying similarities. Common to each position is a belief that we construct knowledge based on what we already know (there is no tabula rasa) and that learning is an active rather than a passive process.


## Core Beliefs of Constructivism Principles
* New knowledge is built upon the foundation of previous learning,
* Learning is an active rather than passive process,
* Language is an important element in the learning process, and
* The learning environment should be learner-centred.

Interestingly enough as opposite as [Turing's mind is to Von Neumanns](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2782014/turing-machine-vs-von-neuman-machine) the Von Neumann architechture was built from the Turing machine. [Spotting patterns](https://www.samcodes.co.uk/project/game-of-life/) and the birth of the computer age.

In Copenhagen, the quantum meet up with the introduction of atomic theory, the von Neuman and Einsteins debates,
["God Does Not Play Dice"](https://turingchurch.net/riddled-with-gaps-how-the-old-one-plays-at-dice-3ac692ce2892) often called Einstein's biggest blunder - undoubtably chaos theory shifted the game into what Turing had envisioned, AI.

As chaotic as the weather, a linear approach fails to predict the cycles we get trapped into..

 > Tommaso Toffoli, a quantum computer researcher, puts it best: "In a sense, nature has been continually computing the 'next state' of the universe for billions of years; all we have to do — and, actually, all we can do — is 'hitch a ride' on this huge, ongoing Great Computation."

 No disrespect to the great minds that have connected the pieces together, but in a philosophical sense, Turing understood the consturctivst nature of life as he believed in human intelligence while Von Neumann on the other hand did not have Turing's vision..

[Von Neumann Quotes:](https://todayinsci.com/V/VonNeumann_John/VonNeumannJohn-Quotations.htm)

 >When we talk mathematics, we may be discussing a secondary language built on the primary language of the nervous system.

 >Furthermore, it’s equally evident that what goes on is actually one degree better than self-reproduction, for organisms appear to have gotten more elaborate in the course of time. Today's organisms are phylogenetically descended from others which were vastly simpler than they are, so much simpler, in fact, that it’s inconceivable, how any kind of description of the latter, complex organism could have existed in the earlier one. It’s not easy to imagine in what sense a gene, which is probably a low order affair, can contain a description of the human being which will come from it. But in this case you can say that since the gene has its effect only within another human organism, it probably need not contain a complete description of what is to happen, but only a few cues for a few alternatives. However, this is not so in phylogenetic evolution. That starts from simple entities, surrounded by an unliving amorphous milieu, and produce, something more complicated. Evidently, these organisms have the ability to produce something more complicated than themselves.

>The other line of argument, which leads to the opposite conclusion, arises from looking at artificial automata. Everyone knows that a machine tool is more complicated than the elements which can be made with it, and that, generally speaking, an automaton A, which can make an automaton B, must contain a complete description of B, and also rules on how to behave while effecting the synthesis. So, one gets a very strong impression that complication, or productive potentiality in an organization, is degenerative, that an organization which synthesizes something is necessarily more complicated, of a higher order, than the organization it synthesizes. This conclusion, arrived at by considering artificial automaton, is clearly opposite to our early conclusion, arrived at by considering living organisms.

[Blank-State/ Tabula-Rasa Computing](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Tabula_rasa)
In reality, autonomous agents are provided with an initial data set or knowledge base, but this should not be immutable or it will hamper autonomy and heuristic ability. Even if the data set is empty, it can usually be argued that there is an in-built bias in the reasoning and planning mechanisms. Either intentionally or unintentionally placed there by the human designer, it thus negates the true spirit of tabula rasa.

Generally people now recognize the fact that most of the brain is indeed preprogrammed and organized in order to process sensory input, motor control, emotions and natural responses. These preprogrammed parts of the brain then learn and refine their ability to perform their tasks. The only true clean slate in the brain is the neo-cortex. This part of the brain is involved in thought and decision-making and is strongly linked with the amygdala. The amygdala is involved in responses such as fight or flight and emotions and like other parts of the brain is largely "pre-programmed," but has space to learn within its "programming". The amygdala is important in that it has a strong influence over the neo-cortex. There is much debate as to whether the amygdala prevents the neo-cortex from being defined as a clean slate.
