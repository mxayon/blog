## Why

We are evolving and must think the same as the end receiver of the communication channel, the influx of data accelerating increases the thirst for more..

Cogito Ergo Sum, the self realizing logic that instantiates an object to existence in the same form
poetry sets a feeling moving.
Expounding on this principle, in a self actualizing sense, imagine how Von Neumann felt or
Oppenheimer working on the atom bomb. And Von Neuman - who used game theory for [Zero-sum Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) during the cold war and came up with a system of "Mutually Assured Destruction" - which then paved way for the internet today.

[Von Neumann-book](https://books.google.com/books?id=2-PeDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=self+actualization+von+neumann&source=bl&ots=0yT0NkPSTl&sig=ACfU3U1MPr7F7pvcjtnBs9gP98Wayb0i3Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj8ycjS6uDiAhUBHDQIHUnyB5o4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=self%20actualization%20von%20neumann&f=false) working on the cellular automata. Conway's "Game of Life" and Stephen Wolfram knows that interactive algorithms are more important than the underlying mathemathical equations.  The spatial and temporal interaction among entities is key to understanding their complexity.

The Turing degree (named after Alan Turing) or degree of un-solvability of a set of natural numbers measures the level of algorithmic un-solvability of the set..
[Turing Degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_degree) evolved into the turing test.

Constructivism
Default Operations
* Survivability - motion and event, spontaneous alternation, and principle of least effort. (crisis mode)
* Creative Operations - cognitive functions, tool making, figurative thinking, primitive learning and creativity.
* Social Behaviors - foraging, navigation, facial recognition, privacy, stealth & autonomy.
* Self-Awareness - self-recognition for self or non-self identification, self-replication, sensuality and euphoria.
*divisions are not absolute*

> Instinctive computing aims to combine primitive problem-solving strategies with instinctive cognition to solve the evolving cybernetics problems in the digital age such as autonomous robots, data intelligence, security and privacy.

Constructivism covers the philosophical dimension in Self-Singular systems by asking how human intelligence has evolved over time. The pinnacle moments are when the new paved ways sync up to new things.

[Constructivism is explained...](https://www.learning-theories.com/constructivism.html#concepts)
>Constructivism as a paradigm or worldview posits that learning is an active, constructive process. The learner is an information constructor. People actively construct or create their own subjective representations of objective reality. New information is linked to to prior knowledge, thus mental representations are subjective.

>Knowledge is constructed based on personal experiences and hypotheses of the environment. Learners continuously test these hypotheses through social negotiation. Each person has a different interpretation and construction of knowledge process. The learner is not a blank slate (tabula rasa) but brings past experiences and cultural factors to a situation

Piaget's Theory of Intellectual Growth evolved into to Vygotsky's addition of a ZDP and his understanding of the socio-historical psychology of learning put Constructivism in motion.

[Historical and Contemporary Significance of Vygotsky's Sociohistorical Psychology](http://www.sonic.net/~cr2/sociohis.htm)
>Whereas most other psychologists postulate intra-organismic determinants of psychological phenomena (such as physiological mechanisms or free will) or some interaction between intra-organismic and social factors, Vygotsky regarded human psychology as entirely social.

>An adult's essence is found in the essence of the environmental conditions.
                                              -Vygotsky and Luria, 1930/1993


Today, Constructivism is a new wave of evolutionary learning brought by computers and 2d / 3d digestion.
[Constructivism and Technology](http://www.teach-nology.com/currenttrends/constructivism/and_technology/)

> Constructivism and technology are working hand-in-hand in the present day. With regards to geometry, constructivism and technology work together to produce a better understanding of the middle school curriculum. Students should be able to identify direction, orientation, have a clear perception of object relation. Making logical deductions from the geometric shapes and patterns is the next step in this learning process. Constructivism and technology allow for computers to generate both two-dimensional objects and three-dimensional objects on the screen. This enables students to view the screen and move the shapes either to another side, turned around completed, or stretched, turned, or flipped. This gives the students a better perspective of the item which they cannot hold in their hand. They can then develop better understanding of spatial sense.

Constructivism broke free from instructionalism when theorists started asking these 3 main questions...

* What does it mean to know something?
* How do we come to know it?
* How does this knowledge influence our thinking processes?


The first dimension defines the constructivist position along a continuum between an understanding of reality as being objective at one end, and a view that reality is defined subjectively at the other end.

The second dimension defines each position on a continuum where knowledge is either socially constructed at the one end, or individually constructed at the other end. This dimension examines the degree to which social, contextual, and cultural factors determine our constructed knowledge.

Despite the differences of each position along these two dimensions, each constructivist position has underlying similarities. Common to each position is a belief that we construct knowledge based on what we already know (there is no tabula rasa) and that learning is an active rather than a passive process.


## Core Beliefs of Constructivism Principles
* New knowledge is built upon the foundation of previous learning,
* Learning is an active rather than passive process,
* Language is an important element in the learning process, and
* The learning environment should be learner-centred.
