[VIEW EVO EPOCH CHRONO MAP](https://mxnkpl.com/chronomap.html)
## Evo Epoch Chrono Map:
The Evolutionary Epochs Chrono Map is a detailed map type cheatsheet that spreads out some points in time that tries to put in to account how revolutionary an invention is based on other variables around it.

The idea is to try provide the research links attached to each object, and keep inspiration running free.

Adobe Illustrator File is still under WIP. (Currently at the Atomic Era) - Significant congestion of innovation during this time so I will need to revisit the spread out scale.

To follow will be a spreadsheet with all the pertinent events and dates to share, as well as the links to the research. Each time I circle back to the point in history, with a different perspective I come up with another layer of events.

My cheatsheet was created as a quick mock up or prototype of explaining specific points in time in why things are all connected.

## Studying Tooling as Tools for Tools

Looking at bootstrapped tools and their origins, it's important to look at the necessity behind the creation. Like bootstrapping, branches of science are made to measure more branches of science, propelling more self-awareness as human beings.

Logic is the basis of computer science and information technology. Looking at the philosophical implications leads to clues on how technology was invented to extend human capabilities. On the deepest sense, the patterns of growth have been driven by measurement and to share new knowledge. Each layer compounded into a force that breaks the barrier limiting humans perception of reality at that time.

The biggest learning experience is to think exponentially. Like ballistics to NASA, how we got to the stars is an incremental layer cake of perfected bootstrapped tools after tools for measurement and _interstellar_ communication. The massive task of taking account external variables that have affected our thinking could go on forever. A shift in view from the tiny fragments that built time then to view the whole picture, gives a feeling of an overview effect.
[Astronauts have expereinced a physcial sense of this "zoomed out" dissonance in perspective.](https://www.inverse.com/article/42902-nasa-astronauts-describe-overview-effect-everything-changed)


Interestingly this must have what discovery felt like during the beginning of time since each incremental change in knowledge (or the very first one) has nothing to compare it to.

There is also the proof that all the revolutions are ignited by peoples abilities to start sharing knowledge. "Guttenberg democratized revolution" [Guttenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratization_of_knowledge); Or how the internet was created by the air force with the network of nodes.

The expanding universe can explain a lot of the behavior of organisms. It follows the same accordion pattern from on a macro level  as biology itself mirrors self-singularity.
[Turing's Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern), makes the connection of human-energy sugar consumption and Mandelbrot's fractals. [Morphogenisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Basis_of_Morphogenesis) and pattern formation of self-singulary evolving entities.

> Following this hint, the scientists, based at the CRG and are now at EMBL, expanded Turing's original theory by using graph theory, a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of networks and makes it easier to work with complex, realistic systems. This led to the realization that network topology, the structure of the feedback between the networks' components, is what determines many fundamental properties of a Turing system. Their new topological theory provides a unifying view of many crucial properties for Turing systems that were previously not well understood and explicitly defines what is required to make a successful Turing system.

> Alan Turing was neither a biologist nor a chemist, and yet the paper he published in 1952, ‘The chemical basis of morphogenesis’, on the spontaneous formation of patterns in systems undergoing reaction and diffusion of their ingredients has had a substantial impact on both fields, as well as in other areas as disparate as geomorphology and criminology. Motivated by the question of how a spherical embryo becomes a decidedly non-spherical organism such as a human being, Turing devised a mathematical model that explained how random fluctuations can drive the emergence of pattern and structure from initial uniformity. The spontaneous appearance of pattern and form in a system far away from its equilibrium state occurs in many types of natural process, and in some artificial ones too.

## Immeasurable Unknown

Blind cartography during the dark ages, scientific maps, Tuftean design principles, hand drawn misrepresented maps a global satellite positioning system. Now just left with eliminating unknowns in the deep sea and outer-space. We have built the Hubble telescope allowing us to reach for the stars and map out our cosmological universe that brings us back to the beginning of time.

[Hubble's Law](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/senior/cosmicengine/hubble.html)


Humanity has evolved through exploring the immeasurable unknown.


Today, foreseeing a [product renaissance](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/future-of-product-design) we know the shift in attitude is where movement starts. It would be good to look at the change of humanities receptivity towards new ideas through out time. To really get an idea is to consider all the walls in between and how hard it was to climb.

Algorithms, the Internet, Pi, Sorting Algorithms, Qubits, Booleans, became infinitely more interesting when I looked up what was around them.



## About
What really kept me going is imagining a world that mostly thrives off of a sharing and open environment.
The roadmap and table of references and dates (to follow) can be used in contrast to other evolutionary perspectives.


## Big Bang

 Back to Hubble's Law and how everything goes back to where we came from, in a way. The Big Bang theme song is clever and catchy.
 Manages to tie in the spin-off Young Sheldon in a continuous and seem-less story line.  


Getting back to the project, at the start of the internet era, I came across a talk by
[Tim Berner's Lee](https://youtu.be/OM6XIICm_qo)
about sharing links and data. A semantic and conscious web revolution from collective intelligence.

## Collective Intelligence


[Douglas Englebart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) created the mouse and frequently spoke of Collective Intelligence. More than the mouse, he envisioned a whole new human computer interaction environment during the Mother of all Demos in 1968. The mouse originally called an "x-y position device" and one of the first GUIs because he wanted to change the course & direction he saw technology going if there wasn't a change in the way we program this behavior. He believed improving the way humans interacted with computers would be creative instead of destructive.


Thinking about how profound our thoughts have evolved overtime, and all the breakthroughs are a testament to being resilient. 

The roadmap points out the intersections where change broke through.
