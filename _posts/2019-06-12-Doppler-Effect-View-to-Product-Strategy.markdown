## Product Organisms
Complacency isn’t a solution to a good work environment.
Only experienced management would know the importance of a check and balance system in order to retain the best type of promoters from within - the workers who advocate for change and growth is what keeps an organism thriving and not shrinking.

## We know measuring change is important.

Brilliant innovators know this quotient at heart, and are aware of how hard it was to implement a paradigm shift.
'Turning points' are highly subjective and therefore more important to measure in synergistic systems.

As above and so below, it is important to have the same self-actualization we expect from what we invoke.

If a whole company, or the entire product strategy plan is contained in self-sustaining cells, each cell is tested and integrated after exploiting and categorizing possible outcomes. Following steps that can be implemented to the entire organism as a whole, but detailed enough to let the cell evolve independently yet parallel to objective and core goals.

There is always chaos but with out a clear definition of goals and check and balance systems in place, the chaos will be hard to track or measure and impossible to harness the momentum of the chaos for the organisms growth benefit.

## Product Revolution
Through out time, companies evolved from products and products are revolutionary. Tools are made from applied sciences used to adapt to revolutions. Questions have lead to measurements, amalgamating into scientific theory. Seeing the patterns in possible paths is giving reverence to humanities receptivity.

Design isn’t just the overall structure of a product and marketing, it’s in the beginning and the end, the alpha and omega, from inception to rebirth. Good design has receptivity at its core before rolling out measured features. I feel passionate workers who questions who the systems work should be enabled to explore what they see in the product / company. Much like a purposeful design decision, these catalysts for change should be allowed to live on its own, focused on its own patterns of improvement but inline with product’s direction.

## The Expanding User-verse
I think of the expanding universe, and how all the energy encapsulated in time to see if we are cooling and shrinking or heating up and expanding. If a product or a company is complacent is not receptive to a heating and expanding model, it maybe on it’s way to Re-birth before heating up and expanding again. Design thinking, Product Management and the scientific measurements of the universe come hand in hand. A shrinking mindset will reject change, in the same light design opens up doors.
