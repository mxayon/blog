## Work Organisms
Complacency isn’t a solution to a good work environment.
Only experience would teach the importance of a check and balance system in order to retain the best type of promoters from within - the workers who advocate for change and growth is what keeps an organism thriving and not shrinking.

- "How we do everything is how we do anything"
- "Mindful Transitions" aims to bring back humanity to the work place.
- Create Early detection signals - Start - Stop - Continue
- Constant engagement and check-ins
- Open and Honest communication


I find people in an organization in this matter is comparable to design in a product. Integral and self-singular.  

## We know measuring change is important.

Brilliant innovators know this quotient at heart, and are aware of how hard it was to implement a paradigm shift.
'Turning points' are highly subjective and therefore more important to measure in synergistic systems.

Following the squeaky wheel can bring the most improvements.

There is always chaos but with out a clear definition of goals and check and balance systems in place, the chaos will be hard to track or measure and impossible to harness the momentum of the chaos for the organisms growth benefit.

## Organic Revolutions
Through out time, systems evolved from tools and tools are revolutionary. Tools are made from applied sciences used to adapt to revolutions. Questions have lead to measurements, amalgamating into scientific theory. Seeing the patterns in possible paths is giving reverence to humanities receptivity.

Design isn’t just the overall structure of a product, it’s in the beginning and the end, from inception to rebirth. In a revolution, it starts with an inventor and necessity. Good design has receptivity at its core before rolling out measured features. I feel that passion comes from taking a sense of ownership and liberty to instigate change. Much like purposeful design decision, these catalysts for change thrive on its own, focused on its own patterns of improvement but inline with product’s direction.

## The Expanding Universe
I think of the expanding universe, and how all the energy encapsulated in time to see if we are cooling and shrinking or heating up and expanding. If a system is complacent & is not receptive to a heating and expanding model, it maybe on it’s way to Re-birth before heating up and expanding again. Design thinking, Product Management and the scientific measurements of the universe come hand in hand. Rejecting evolution equates a shrinking view, in the same way design opens horizons.
