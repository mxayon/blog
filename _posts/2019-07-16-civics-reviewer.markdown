## On being a citizen
The road to getting a citizenship is a long and for some almost impossible journey.
While the essence of our constitution was written to establish freedom and self-governance, the reality of the matter is much less inviting.
The framers of the constitution escaped persecution, unfair taxation from a single authority or "king" and designed a system for the people, by the people. A separation of power sets the stage and continual checks and balances maintains the flow.

The constitution instantiates it's own freedom and self-governance with it's first three words "We The People".

Immanuel Kant, who was an advocate for federalism, said that "the problem of setting up a state can be solved even by a nation of devils" so long as they possess an appropriate constitution which pits opposing factions against each other with a system of checks and balances. In particular individual states required a federation as a safeguard against the possibility of war. - [Federalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism#Immanuel_Kant)

Kant argued the sum of all objects, the empirical world, is a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations. Kant introduces the thing-in-itself as follows:

> And we indeed,
rightly considering objects of sense as mere appearances,
confess thereby that they are based upon a thing in itself,
though we know not this thing as it is in itself,
but only know its appearances, viz.,
the way in which our senses are affected by this unknown something.
          — Prolegomena, § 32

As a newfound citizen, an ability to vote federally goes beyond personal interests. I gained a disposition in which I can now act as an enabled citizen knowing my rights and responsibilities. An essential component to developing a voice.

"Taxation without representation" was what made the founding fathers write the declaration of independence, which is pretty much what it feels like living and working in a society where you cant vote. The constitution is what defines the government and establishes the basic rights of all people. Each amendment to the constitution is integrated in accordance of the governing power: "We the People".

## The Bill of Rights
The first ten amendments to the constitution were established for our individual civil rights and liberties.

First Amendment:
Freedom of religion, freedom of speech and the press, the right to assemble, the right to petition government.

Second Amendment: The right to form a militia and to keep and bear arms.

Third Amendment: The right not to have soldiers in one's home.

Fourth Amendment: Protection against unreasonable search and seizure.

Fifth Amendment: No one can be tried for a serious crime unless indicted (accused) by a grand jury. No one can be forced to testify against herself or himself. No one can be punished without due process of law. People must be paid for property taken for public use.

Sixth Amendment: People have a right to a speedy trial, to legal counsel, and to confront their accusers.

Seventh Amendment: People have the right to a jury trial in civil suits exceeding $20.

Eighth Amendment: Protection against excessive bail (money to release a person from jail), stiff fines, and cruel and unusual punishment.

Ninth Amendment: Because there are so many basic human rights, not all of them could be listed in the Constitution. This amendment means that the rights that are enumerated cannot infringe upon rights that are not listed in the Constitution.

Tenth Amendment: Powers not given to the federal government by the Constitution belong to the states or the people.

Thirteenth Amendment (1865): Slavery shall not be allowed in the U.S.

Nineteenth Amendment (1920): Women have the right to vote.

Twenty-sixth Amendment (1971): U.S. citizens who are 18 years of age or older have the right to vote. (Previously, they had to be 21 years old.)
