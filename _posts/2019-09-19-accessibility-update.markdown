## Evolving and being an ally
Today on twitter I saw a super important thread about something I've failed to look at as a web developer and accessibility in general. Sticky footers and headers does not allow much room for page zooms.

Even with planning with accessibility-first goals, this may lead me to go back to the drawing board on most apps perceived as accessible in feature.

### Tools

During my last research efforts to implement a purely accessible web application, the tools I found were amazing from the developer community
 - a11y
 - contrast extension

 and voice over demonstrations with built in mac features.
