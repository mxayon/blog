description: Being a better Ally and updating my accessibility knowledge!

## Evolving and being an ally
Today on twitter I saw a super important thread about something I've failed to look at as a web developer and accessibility in general. Sticky footers and headers does not allow much room for page zooms.

Even with planning with accessibility-first goals, this may lead me to go back to the drawing board on most apps perceived as accessible in feature.

### Tools

During my last research efforts to implement a purely accessible web application, the tools I found were amazing from the developer community
 - [a11y](https://a11yproject.com/)
 - [Accessibility Plugins](https://www.digitala11y.com/accessibility-plug-ins-ie-chrome-firefox-browsers)

 and voice over demonstrations with built in mac features.

### To do's:

In order to orient a better accessible application for designing the front-end, the css-grid holy-grail approach might not be ideal.
