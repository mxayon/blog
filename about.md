<p> A Travel Log for Designing, Constructing, Fortifying and Evolving.
A learning toolkit to share some resources and projects. Connecting the dots, correcting the fumbles and crafting excitement. </p>
<p>
This blog is both a blog and a syllabus (byllogybus) to guide a developer like me who likes to learn via exploration. I dig into what drives the world to change and innovate.

<p>
Much as how studying an atom has taught us about energy, I believe in respecting each component of the cog in a product to get a full understanding of how it all fits.

I found that growing through the discipline of engineering, was an invaluable way to utilize & structure my curiosity. My first product was invented through my passion, a video animation and video editing production. Through this work, I can envision fast-paced environment as exciting. I dream of being able to make order of the chaos, to fashion tools for ease of utility and visual presentation of tasks. With video work, multiple ideas run in my head and I have learned uncanny but effective ways to manage different tasks parallel with efficient organization. I always dream of the "UX" of the work environment and spend a lot of time implementing different ways to make the ultimate work-engine dashboard.

This is a journal of notes - Travel Logging, making a database of inter-wingular backup-plans to defy the odds when the timing is strategic.
