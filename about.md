<h2>Maximo Nakpil</h2>
<p>Full-Stack Developer, Relentless Code Mechanic, Data Detective</p>


<p> A learning toolkit to share some resources and projects. Motivated by trying to find what connects us, through out time, to science and computational thinking. </p>

**key alert!** Repetition is Key! This blog is both a blog and a syllabus (Byllogybus) to guide a developer like me who likes to learn via exploration. As it turns out, if you like to explore it's best to keep documentation to come back to inorder to explore some more! I dig deep into 'the why' part of needing to understand Data Structures and Algorithms, by researching how we all came to modernity we call today.

I found a lot more purpose in the work of crunching the numbers and appreciating the delicate syntax a language runs with instead of taking it just as an extra step to the process.

fun in fundamentals
when you can takle big concepts and break them down into at least a sequence.
Computer Science and Information Techonology.

How a hard headed developer adapted the essentials necessary to be a competent workhorse.
