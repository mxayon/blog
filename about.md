<p> A Travel Log for Designing, Constructing and Evolving.
A learning toolkit to share some resources and projects. Connecting the dots, correcting the fumbles and crafting excitement. </p>
<p>
This blog is both a blog and a syllabus (byllogybus) to guide a developer like me who likes to learn via exploration. I dig into what drives the world to change and innovate.
</p>
<p>
Much as how studying an atom has taught us about energy, I believe in respecting each component of the cog in a product to get a full understanding of how it all fits.
</p>
<p>
I found that growing through the discipline of engineering, was an invaluable way to utilize & structure my curiosity. My first product was invented through my passion, a video and video editing production. I day dream with restructuring new solutions in the graphical user interface of my imagination. I'd like to one day make the ultimate work-engine dashboard. Motivated by blue skies thinking and learning from others.

<p>
This is a journal of notes - Travel Logging, making a repository of inter-wingular connections and sharing learnings to others and future self.
