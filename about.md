<p> A Travel Log for Designing, Constructing and Evolving. A journey through the intersections and documenting evolution through tools.
A learning toolkit to share some resources and projects. Connecting the dots, correcting the fumbles and crafting excitement. </p>
<p>
This blog is both a blog and a syllabus (byllogybus) of really cool lessons along the way. No idea too crazy, but this is a sneak-peak to them before an idea gets refined.

I found that growing through the discipline of engineering, was an invaluable way to utilize & structure my curiosity. I day dream with restructuring new solutions in the graphical user interface of my imagination. I'd like to one day make the ultimate work-engine dashboard. Motivated by blue skies thinking and learning from others.

This is a journal of notes - Travel Logging, making a repository of
